# StarlightClub_Rules
Starlight World brings the most to the community by providing a place to chat, post cringe, share your artwork, and more, and it is important to follow these rules.

## Never post NSFW content on this server.
It is a violation of Discord's Terms of Service to post NSFW content outside NSFW channels. This goes for Star Club, and posting such content can lead to an instant ban.

## Spamming is highly prohibited on this server.
You can not send walls of text, repetitions of the same message, mixed cases, excessive emojis, etc.

## Avoid sensative topics.
This includes but is not limited to the following:
- Political or religious views of any kind
- Suicidal thoughts or actions
- Controversial TikTok trends
- Dirty jokes hidden in games or movies

## Do not send malicious links.
Do not send any links to malicious sites, pornographic material, or otherwise untrusted sources. If a link to a Twitter page pops up on this server containing any nsfw content, that page will be reported to Discord, and any action taken on the associated Twitter account will be at their discretion as well. If you stumble upon a link sent by someone else which violates this rule, please report it via DM.

## Respect admins/mods.
The last thing you want to do on Discord is disrespect a staff member or administrator on any server, especially if it's a YouTuber. On this server, it is highly forbidden, and can lead to a permenant unappealable ban from the server.

## You must be 13 or older to use Discord.
Staff make it clear in their Terms of Service that they will take down any Discord servers if they are filled with members who are underage. If you are 12 or under, you do not need to be on Discord. If anyone suspects you might be underage, you will be banned.

## Do not send Discord invites
Starlight Club takes no position in banning members from other servers and community, but takes safety as the \#1 priority. Discord invites are strictly prohibited.

## Do not share personal information
Respect other people's privacy. Do not share or ask for sensative details, including:
- IP addresses
- Social security numbers
- Emails
- Phone numbers
- Home addresses
